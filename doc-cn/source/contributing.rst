Contributing to SWUpdate
========================

Contributions are welcome ! Please follow the following guideline for contributions.

Contribution Checklist
----------------------

These are mostly general recommendations and are common practise in a lot of
FOSS projects.

- use git to manage your changes [*recomended*]

- follow as much as possible kernel codestyle [*recomended*]
  Nevertheless, some rules are not so strict as in kernel. The maximum line length
  can be extended over 80 chars if this increase code readability.

- add the required copyright header to each new file introduced [**required**]

- add signed-off to all patches [**required**]
    - to certify the "Developer's Certificate of Origin", see below
    - check with your employer when not working on your own!

- add version number for your patches if follow-up versions are requested [*recomended*]
    - Add a "Change from Vx" description under the commit message to take track
      of the history of the patch.
    - It is suggested to use excellent "patman" tool to manage patches series.
      This is part of U-Boot's project (tools/patman), but it can be used in other projects, too.

- check that your patches do not break build [**required**]

  - There is a set of configuration files in the `configs/` directory.
    Please run a build for all files in the directory to ensure that SWUpdate is
    still buildable from configurations different as yours.

- post patches to mailing list [**required**]
    - use `git format-patch` to generate your patches.
    - use `git send-email` if possible. This avoid corruptions due
      to the mailers
    - add a prefix [meta-swupdate] if patches are intended to the Yocto's meta layer.
    - send patches inline, do not append them
    - no HTML emails!

- do not use github Pull Request. github facilities are not used for this project.
  The review is done in a single place : the Mailing List. PR from github are ignored.

Patches are tracked by patchwork (see http://jk.ozlabs.org/projects/patchwork/).
You can see the status of your patches at http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/swupdate/list.
